# Project Health Assessment

_Date: 2024-_

## Summary

The current repository fails basic static validation. Running `python -m compileall .` raises multiple syntax and indentation errors that prevent the codebase from importing successfully. The most critical failures originate from merge-conflicted files inside `core/`, `goals/`, `language/` and `reasoning/` packages. These must be resolved before runtime features can work.

## Detected Blocking Issues

| File | Problem | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `core/autopilot.py` | Duplicate constructor definitions and unreachable code | Partially fixed in this commit. |
| `core/cognitive_architecture.py` | Interleaved duplicate blocks leading to unmatched braces and unreachable code | Needs full merge conflict resolution. |
| `goals/__init__.py` | Multiple duplicate sections and malformed assignments (`=` inside expressions) | Goal management cannot initialise. |
| `goals/curiosity.py` | Missing module header and stray prose before imports | Prevents module import. |
| `goals/dag_store.py` | Contains smart quotes and French prose breaking Python syntax | Stops DAG persistence from loading. |
| `language/__init__.py` | `from __future__` import not at the top of the file | Module import aborts immediately. |
| `reasoning/structures.py` | Parenthesis mismatch | Parsing of reasoning schemas fails. |

The `compileall` execution log showing these failures is captured in the development notes (see terminal log chunk `ce5506`).

## Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Resolve merge artefacts**: Several files contain duplicated code blocks and conflicting implementations. Rewrite or manually merge the affected sections to produce a coherent implementation.
2. **Re-run static validation**: After fixing the syntax issues, re-run `python -m compileall .` and targeted unit/integration tests to ensure imports succeed.
3. **Add automated linting**: Introduce a lightweight CI step (e.g. `python -m compileall` or `ruff --select=E`) to catch syntax regressions early.
4. **Document subsystem contracts**: The architecture would benefit from README notes describing expected interfaces between autonomy, goals, language and reasoning packages. This will simplify future merges.

## Next Steps

- Prioritise repairing `core/cognitive_architecture.py` and the `goals` package; the rest of the runtime relies on them.
- Once syntax is restored, exercise `main.py` / `orchestrator.py` in a controlled environment to verify runtime behaviour.
- Consider adding regression tests for Autopilot orchestration and goal scheduling once the foundational modules are stable.
